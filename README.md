# LCS-Longest-Common-Subsequence-
The solution of the maximum common subsequence problem, among others, has application in bioinformatics, and in particular in the analysis of similarities in DNA sequences. DNA sequences are represented by strings formed by 4 characters (A,G,C,T) representing the nucleotides adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.
